# Let's Build a Reactive Programming Library

This is the final version of the project that I live coded at CocoaConf Seattle 2016.

It demonstrates a miniature reactive programming framework, *Reactionary*.

Also of interest:
- a reactive Core Data adapter that converts from `NSManagedObjects` to Swift value types
- a generic protocol and extension for making any UIControl reactive with just a few of lines of code
- the skeleton of a value-type-only iOS app

The reactive Core Data adapter may be a terrible idea at scale, but it's elegant and easy to program against. 
Hopefully this is a valuable source of ideas, or at least intriguing.
